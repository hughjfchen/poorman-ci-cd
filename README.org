* What is it

This is the poor man's CI/CD system and it aims to the following goals:

- Simple :: No flow, no pipeline, you know how to build your project and
  deploy it, so you just provide one script to build and the other one
  to deploy.
- Minimal :: Simple means it does not depends on other tools, it just
  uses the basic, always available tools.
- Universal :: Minimal means it can be deployed almost everywhere as the
  dependences provided.

For more information about the design and implementation details, please
refer to the [[./poormanscicd.org]].

* how to use it

** setup

The =poormanscicd= follows the =literate programming= so you must =tangle= to
a script before you can run the script. Here is the detail procedure:

1. open the [[./poormanscicd.org]] file with =emacs= and =orgmode= enable
2. fill in the =input= parameters as you want
3. tangle to the scripts(usually with key binding C - c C - v t)
4. three scripts will be generated:
   |---------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | script              | run on            | remarks                                                                |
   |---------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | setup-ci-server.sh  | CI server         | this script should be run on the CI server with passwordless sudo user |
   | setup-cd-server.sh  | CD server         | this script should be run on the CD server with passwordless sudo user |
   | setup-cicd-local.sh | local dev machine | this script should be run on the local development machine             |
   |---------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
5. run =setup-ci-server.sh= on the =CI Server= first
6. then run =setup-cd-server.sh= on the =CD serfver=
7. finally run =setup-cicd-local.sh= on the local development machine

** start CI/CD

After having finished the above config on CI, CD machine and local side, you just need
to run following command once you want to kick off CI/CD:

#+begin_src  bash :tangle no
git push <ci-server> main
#+end_src

** follow the CI/CD output

If you want to follow the CI/CD output, you can run the following command on the local
machhine:

#+begin_src  bash :tangle no
follow-ci-log.sh
#+end_src

** view the CI/CD log

If you want to view the whole CI/CD log, you can run the following command on the local
machine:

#+begin_src  bash :tangle no
view-ci-log.sh
#+end_src
